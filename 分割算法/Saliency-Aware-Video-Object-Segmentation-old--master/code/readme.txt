The saliency demo code (computeSaliency.m) produces slightly different results 
to those reported in the paper [1]. This is due to changes in the parameters and 
the final saliency results are stored in data/outputs/(videoname)/final_saliency.
Saliency results stored in the folder 'intra-frame_saliency' and 'inter-frame saliency'
are generated by our intra-frame graph and inter-frame graph respectively.
